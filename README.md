# Sending SMS for Librato Alerts

This is a PHP example of using the [PortaText PHP SDK](https://github.com/PortaText/php-sdk) to receive
[Librato](http://www.librato.com/) alerts and send SMS instead.

For this to work you should setup a [Custom Webhook Integration](http://support.metrics.librato.com/knowledgebase/articles/36119-custom-service-integrations-webhook) in your Librato account.
